# Next Actions

Need to revisit this entirely, so that I can create something that works
correctly, now that I'm no longer attempting to create a continuation API for
every JavaScript library I create.

Want to rename the project to become simply `packet`.

Considering dropping the function callback, using only generated object, to
simplify the code, and to simplify the API documentation. Definately need to
simplify the API documentation. Do not want to alienate people by being all
things for everyone.
